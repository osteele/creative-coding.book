JavaScript is a programming language (a way of instructing the computer), often
used to make web apps calculate, manipulate HTML and CSS, and respond to user
actions. It can also be used on servers and, more recently, embedded devices.
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape
Communications. At the time, Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems in order
to out-maneuver Microsoft, who was attempting to push Netscape (who had the
dominate web browser at the time) out of the market by pre-installing Internet
Explorer on all PCs. Brendan spent ten days developing the scripting language
that would eventually be called JavaScript, for both browsers and servers. It
was called JavaScript purely for marketing purposes — the Java programming
language was extremely popular at the time (it still is used today).

<!-- Introduction to JavaScript for the Modern Web
The way that we’ll teach you JavaScript is mainly within the context of the modern web and ReactJS in particular. This has some pros and cons:
Pros: You’ll be be able to put it to use immediately in creating meaningful interactive applications.
Cons: You’re not getting a traditional foundation in programming, so while the concepts are the same, the implementation will be quite different if you use another programming language, or a framework other than React.
If you’d like a more foundational tutorial to study over the long break, I recommend this one from CodeAcademy:
