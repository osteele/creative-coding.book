# Glossary

_**Code**_ \(in our context\) is a synonymous with computer program.

_**Coding**_ is the same as programming. \[Some people have tried to introduce a distinction between the “programming” and “coding”. There are several different ways of using these two words to mean two different things. None of these distinctions is widely adopted.\]

A _**computer program**_ is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. When it’s clear from context, a computer program can be called a _**program**_.

_**JavaScript**_ is a programming language. JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. \(The other two are HTML and CSS.\)

_**Processing**_ is “an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment \(IDE\) built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context“ \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_%28programming_language%29#p5.js)\). We will not work directly with Processing in this course, but it is useful to know this because we will make extensive use of p5.js \(see\).

_**Programming**_ is the process of designing and building computer programs.

A _**programming language**_ \(or _**computer programming language**_\) is a system of rules that describe how text text is interpreted as instructions to a computer. Some programming languages are C, C++, C\#, Java, JavaScript, Lisp, Logo, MATLAB, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scheme.

_**P5.js**_ is a [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) of Processing to JavaScript. What you learn in p5.js you will be able to apply to Processing, and vice versa.

A _**Sketch**_ is a program in Processing and p5.js \(next slides\). In some languages, a program is also called a _**script**_.
