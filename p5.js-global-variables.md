# p5.js Global Variables

P5 defines a number of global variables.

We already mentioned about one of them, `frameCount`. The value of this variabl is the number of time that the `draw` function has been called.

Some other useful variables are `width` and `height`, which are the size of the canvas \(in our sketches so far, this is the size of the browser window when the page is loaded\); and `mouseX` and `mouseY`, which are the position of the mouse within the window.

You can find these functions defined on the [p5.js reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/). Find `width`, or `mouseX`, on this page, and then look nearby to see similar variables. _Functions_, like `rect`, that have an effect on the behavior when you _call_ them, are documented with parentheses – `rect()`. Variables, that have a value that you can use in your code, are documented without parentheses – `mouseX`.
